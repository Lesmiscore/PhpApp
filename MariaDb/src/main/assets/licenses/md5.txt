MD5 message-digest algorithm (md5_hash.cpp)

Use of any of this software is governed by the terms of the license below:

/*
 * This code implements the MD5 message-digest algorithm.
 * The algorithm is due to Ron Rivest.  This code was
 * written by Colin Plumb in 1993, no copyright is claimed.
 * This code is in the public domain; do with it what you wish.
 *
 * Equivalent code is available from RSA Data Security, Inc.
 * This code has been tested against that, and is equivalent,
 * except that you don't need to include two pages of legalese
 * with every copy.
 *
 * The code has been modified by Mikael Ronstroem to handle
 * calculating a hash value of a key that is always a multiple
 * of 4 bytes long. Word 0 of the calculated 4-word hash value
 * is returned as the hash value.
