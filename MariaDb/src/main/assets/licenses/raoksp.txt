is the work of Henry Spencer, University of Toronto Zoology, who says of
it "None of this software is derived from Bell software. I had no access
to the source for Bell's versions at the time I wrote it.  This software
is hereby explicitly placed in the public domain.  It may  be  used  for
any purpose on any machine by anyone." I would greatly prefer it if *my*
material received no military use.
