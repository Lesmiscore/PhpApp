<br />
This is pure php server(the one that is available in php since 5.4 version) built for android.<br />
<br />
! Recommended for usage in development or very very small websites with very small amount of visitors couse it this server supports only one request at a time.<br />
<br />
! Most of php modules are turned on(see phpinfo() for exact list).<br />
<br />
! Edit php.ini and resolv.conf as needed, they are loaded from document root directory.<br />
<br />
! Currently it is only for ARM architecture.<br />
<br />
! If openssl is used - don`t forget to create and use custom openssl.cnf file.<br />
<br />
! Sorry but standard php locales wont work(setlocale and such).<br />
